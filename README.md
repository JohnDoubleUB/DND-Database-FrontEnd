# DND Character Sheet Application

In fulfilment of the solo project assignment for QA Consulting

## Index


## The Brief
To create an OOP-based application making use of supporting tools, methodolgies and technologies that demonstrate all of the core modules covered over the training period.
The application must manipulate two tables with full CRUD functionality.
### Solution
For my project I decided to create an application that would allow the user to create dnd characters, edit, view and remove them from a database, there would be separate databases for certain details of the characters such as the race and class.

##### Plan Outline
The plan here would be to have all the interaction on a single page using the fields to both display information of a given character, edit and delete it by using the top most dropdown to either select an existing or new character. The user might also need to write in a characters name to verify that they wanted to delete it (as on one page like this it would be easier for it to be done accidentally)
