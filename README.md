## The Brief
To create an OOP-based application making use of supporting tools, methodolgies and technologies that demonstrate all of the core modules covered over the training period.
The application must manipulate two tables with full CRUD functionality.
### Solution
For my project I decided to create an application that would allow the user to create dnd characters, edit, view and remove them from a database, there would be separate databases for certain details of the characters such as the race and class.
